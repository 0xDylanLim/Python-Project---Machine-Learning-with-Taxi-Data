# Python-Project---Machine-Learning-with-Taxi-Data

You are a data professional in a data consulting firm called Automatidata. Their client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), was impressed with the work you have done and has requested that you build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip, since drivers depend on tips.

1. What are you being asked to do?
Predict if a customer will not leave a tip.

2. What are the ethical implications of the model? What are the consequences of your model making errors?
Drivers who didn't receive tips will probably be upset that the app told them a customer would leave a tip. If it happened often, drivers might not trust the app. Drivers are unlikely to pick up people who are predicted to not leave tips. Customers will have difficulty finding a taxi that will pick them up, and might get angry at the taxi company. Even when the model is correct, people who can't afford to tip will find it more difficult to get taxis, which limits the accessibility of taxi service to those who pay extra.

3. Do the benefits of such a model outweigh the potential problems?
It's not good to disincentivize drivers from picking up customers. It could also cause a customer backlash. The problems seem to outweigh the benefits.

4. Would you proceed with the request to build this model? Why or why not?
No. Effectively limiting equal access to taxis is ethically problematic, and carries a lot of risk.

5. Can the objective be modified to make it less problematic?
We can build a model that predicts the most generous customers. This could accomplish the goal of helping taxi drivers increase their earnings from tips while preventing the wrongful exclusion of certain people from using taxis.
